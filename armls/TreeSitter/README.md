# TreeSitter C# bindings #

This package contains C# bindings for the APIs in TreeSitter C library. Wherever possible, I have tried to keep the public facing names and structure of all exposed identifiers same as the underlying library. For more information on TreeSitter and its API, see [TreeSitter website](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/) and [API header file](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter/blob/master/lib/include/tree_sitter/api.h).
